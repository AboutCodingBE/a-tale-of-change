# A tale of change

This is an experience driven exercise for starting developers. The aim of this exercise is to bring insight in some
fundamental software design principles: Connascence, coupling, cohesion and abstraction. 

This is a scripted exercise. The point is that you follow the script which will lead you into some hopefully insightful 
situations. To get the maximum out of this exercise, you have to act and follow the script. 

The context of the exercise is not very realistic. I am aware of that. I choose a coffee machine example because it is 
familiar to most people. I want to combine something well known so that the introduction of more technical aspects comes
a bit easier.
